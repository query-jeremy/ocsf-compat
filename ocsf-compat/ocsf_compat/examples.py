"""OCSF Backwards Compatibility Validator PoC

This demonstrates how the APIs the sibling ocsf-schema and ocsf-diff packages
can be used to validate backwards compatibility between two OCSF schemata.

There are three checks:
 1. Check for removed (or renamed) events
 2. Check for changed requirements
 3. Check for changed types

A production-grade validator would accept arguments from a CLI, configuration
file, or environment variables. The structure of its checks should be reusable,
its output standardized, and its methods constrained by the type system. But
this should get the point across.
