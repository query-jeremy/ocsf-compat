"""A validation rule to identify removed or renamed objects, events, attributes, and enums.

There are separate Finding classes for removal and renaming of each type of
record. This is to allow for flexibility in configuring the severity of the
findings.

Renaming is detected when an element is removed *and* an element with the same
caption or class_uid is added to the same set.

break compatibility between schemas, as can removing attributes of events and
