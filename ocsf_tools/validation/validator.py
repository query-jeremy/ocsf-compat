"""A simple framework for validation programs.

This is intended to be used for validating proposed changes to the OCSF schema,
but it's generic (or basic) enough to serve other purposes.

A Validator contains Rules that produce Findings.

Validators and Rules are generic, so they can be used with an appropriate
Context. The context on which they operate may be an OCSF repository, a schema,
etc.

Rules perform checks on the validator context and yield Findings if they find
any violations (or bendings) of the rule they represent. See the compatibility
package for examples.

Findings have a default severity of ERROR, but this can be overridden by
specific classes of Finding. Additionally, a Validator can accept a map of
finding class names to severities to allow this to be configured so that users
can determine which findings should, for example, prevent a PR from being
merged.
